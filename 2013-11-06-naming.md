As the saying goes, there are only 2 hard things in programming: naming, cache invalidation, and off-by-one-errors.

_Wakka wakka._

Names bring ideas into focus. As a programmer, what you call a variable, method, function, class, or even the project itself can be one of the most important decisions you make.

Good names establishes intention, informing how something should be used. They unite a codebase around a set of shared concepts. Often, the best way to reduce or eliminate bugs is to refactor how things are named (an exercise, which may reveal some faulty assumptions along the way).

What makes a good name? Well, it must be descriptive, but not overly so. It must avoid ambiguity among other similarly-named modules, while being both memorable and easy to spell. A good name builds on an existing vocabulary, using known words in a way most people agree upon within the particular domain.

Naming is a subjective exercise. Each community and indeed each project has its own milleu of standards and conventions. What follows are guidelines representative of Objective-C code written today.

## Leading By Example

Make no mistake: Objective-C is Apple's language, for all intents and purposes. If you are writing Objective-C, you are almost necessarily developing on their platform. Whatever they say goes.

In practice, this has worked out pretty well for us as developers. Apple's code is, more often than not, of exceptional quality. System frameworks are remarkably well-designed,usually documented, and relatively self-consistent. That's not to say that Apple doesn't make mistakes, or is immune from critique, but in all fairness, they really do a great job with the technology we use everyday.

As a consequence of this opinionated, top-down leadership, the rules for naming things in Objective-C is pretty simple: **follow Apple's example**.

Apple summarizes their own API naming conventions as follows:

> - Clarity and brevity are both important, but clarity should never be sacrificed for brevity.
> - Avoid names that are ambiguous.
> - Use verbs in the names of methods or functions that represent actions.
> - Use prefixes for class names and for symbols associated with the class, such as functions and data types.

When designing a new class, peruse the documentation for related functionality, and take note of the patterns and conventions used in the standard frameworks. Every iOS and OS X developer is familiar with how Apple does things, so the closer you can follow their example, the easier it will be for others to get up to speed.

## Design Patterns

What is perhaps most striking about Apple's naming methodologies is their usage of design patterns: MVC, delegates, target-action, observers, the responder chain, facades (viz. class clusters), enumerators, decorators, serializers... the Gang of Four is well represented in Cupertino.
