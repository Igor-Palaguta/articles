Conversion is the tireless errand of software development. Most programming tasks boil down to some variation of transforming data into something more useful.

In the case of user-facing software, converting data into human-readable form is an essential task, and a complex one at that. A user's preferred language, locale, calendar, or currency can all factor into how information should be displayed, as can other constraints, such as a label's dimensions.

All of this is to say that sending `-description` to an object just isn't going to cut it in most circumstances. Even `+stringWithFormat:` is going to ultimately disappoint. No, the real tool for this job is `NSFormatter`.

`NSFormatter` is an abstract class for transforming data into a textual representation. It can also interpret valid textual representations back into data.

Its origins trace back to `NSCell`, which is used to display information and accept user input in tables, form fields, and other views in AppKit. Much of the API design of NSFormatter reflects this.

Foundation provides two concrete subclasses for `NSFormatter`: `NSNumberFormatter` and `NSDateFormatter`. As some of the oldest members of the Foundation framework, these classes are astonishingly well-suited to their respective domains, in that way only decade-old software can.

## NSNumberFormatter

`NSNumberFormatter` handles every aspect of number formatting imaginable, from mathematical and scientific notation, to currencies and percentages. Nearly everything about the formatter can be customized, whether its the currency symbol, grouping separator, number of significant digits, rounding behavior, fractions, character for infinity, string representation for `0`, or maximum / minimum values. It can even write out numbers in several languages!

### Styles

When using an `NSNumberFormatter`, the first order of business is to determine what kind of information you're displaying. Is it a price? Is this a whole number, or should decimal values be shown?

`NSNumberFormatter` can be configured for any one of the following formats, with `-setNumberStyle:`:

To illustrate the differences between each style, here is how the number `12345.6789` would be displayed for each: 

> - `NSNumberFormatterNoStyle`: 12346
> - `NSNumberFormatterDecimalStyle`: 12345.6789
> - `NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle`: $12345.68
> - `NSNumberFormatterPercentStyle`: 1234567%
> - `NSNumberFormatterScientificStyle`: 1.23456789E4
> - `NSNumberFormatterSpellOutStyle`: twelve thousand three hundred forty-five point six seven eight nine

### Locale Awareness

By default, `NSNumberFormatter` will format according to the current locale settings, for things like currency symbol ($, £, €, etc.) and whether to use "," or "." as the decimal separator.

~~~{objective-c}
NSNumberFormatter *numberFormatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
[numberFormatter setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterCurrencyStyle];

for (NSString *identifier in @[@"en_US", @"fr_FR"]) {
    numberFormatter.locale = [NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifier:identifier];
    NSLog(@"%@: %@", identifier, [numberFormatter stringFromNumber:@(1234.5678)]);
}
~~~

    en_US: $1,234.57
    fr_FR: 1 234,57 €

> All of those settings can be overridden on an individual basis, but for most apps, the best strategy would be deferring to the locale's default settings.

### Rounding & Significant Digits

In order to prevent numbers from getting annoyingly pedantic (_"thirty-two point three three, repeating, of course..."_), make sure get a handle on `NSNumberFormatter`'s rounding behavior.

The easiest way to do this, would be to `setUsesSignificantDigits:` to `YES`, and then set minimum and maximum number of significant digits appropriately. For example, a number formatter used for approximate distances in directions, would do well with significant dgitis to the tenths place for miles or kilometers, but only the ones place for feet or meters.

For anything more advanced, an `NSDecimalNumberHandler` object can be passed as the `roundingBehavior` property of a number formatter.

## Re-Using Formatter Instances

Perhaps the most critical detail to keep in mind when using formatters is that they are _extremely_ expensive to create. Even just an `alloc init` of an `NSNumberFormatter` in a tight loop is enough to bring an app to its knees.

Therefore, it's strongly recommended that formatters be created once and re-used as much as possible.

If it's just a single method using a particular formatter, a static instance is a good strategy:

~~~{objective-c}
- (void)fooWithNumber:(NSNumber *)number {
    static NSNumberFormatter *_numberFormatter = nil;
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
        _numberFormatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
        [_numberFormatter setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterDecimalStyle];
    });

    NSString *string = [_numberFormatter stringFromNumber:number];

    // ...
}
~~~

> `dispatch_once` guarantees that the specified block is called only the first time it's encountered.

If the formatter is used across several methods in the same class, that static instance can be refactored into a singleton method:

~~~{objective-c}
+ (NSNumberFormatter *)numberFormatter {
    static NSNumberFormatter *_numberFormatter = nil;
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{
        _numberFormatter = [[NSNumberFormatter alloc] init];
        [_numberFormatter setNumberStyle:NSNumberFormatterDecimalStyle];
    });

    return _numberFormatter;
}
~~~

If the same formatter is privately implemented across several classes, one could either expose it publicly in one of the classes, or implement the static singleton method in a category on `NSNumberFormatter`.
