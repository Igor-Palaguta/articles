Societies function according to implicit and explicit rules. 

> Placeholder from Cocoa Core Competencies

- Methods that return objects typically return nil if they cannot create or find the object. They do not directly return a status code.
- Methods that perform an operation return a Boolean value to indicate success or failure.
- If a method takes a collection object—that is, an NSArray, NSDictionary, or NSSet object—as an argument, do not specify nil to indicate “default” or “no value”; instead, pass in an empty collection object.
- If you are explicitly managing program memory, follow the guidelines and practices for memory management.
