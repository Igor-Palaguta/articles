The most important skill one must develop as an API author is the ability to say "No".

No to that extra convenience method.  
No to exposing that private function.  
No to adding a class for the 10% case.  

For developers who usually ascribe to fairly liberal social or political ideologies, the idea of conservatism may be foreign and counter-intuitive. In this fast-paced software ecosystem that's energized by the new and cool, slow and steady can be a tough sell. However, slow and steady is necesssary if software is expected to be useful to many people for the long haul.

## Justification

Every line of code needs to justify its own existence. Anything that can't should be deleted.

Every instance method, class, or property increases the surface area of an API. The more expansive an API gets, the more difficult it is to understand.

It can be extremely tempting for a library to be all things to all people. After all, code doesn't have a physical cost associated with it, so what's the harm? Without proper restraint, every library has the potential to devolve into a kitchen sink of



## Composition & Convenience

Great APIs make simple tasks easy and hard tasks possible. 

The secret to accomplish this is composition, and this applies on the level of class architecture as well as convenience methods.




## Conservation vs. Stagnation 

Of course, real power comes not from the ability to say "No", but the ability to say "Yes". But there is a difference between being picky and being obstinant, and it can be a real challenge to understand that when faced with a new feature request.
