To be an NSHipster is to care deeply about the craft of writing code. In cultivating a deep understanding and appreciation of Objective-C, its frameworks and ecosystem, one is able to create apps that delight and inspire users.

This book offers a comprehensive, structured approach to learning Objective-C development, from the language and system frameworks, to high-level concerns, like internationalization, design, and community. It is as much a technical manual as it is a thesis on how one should think about code and the practice of coding.
