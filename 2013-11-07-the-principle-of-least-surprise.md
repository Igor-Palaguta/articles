Unlike other disciplines, where a hard day's work is rewarded with a physical manifestation of your efforts, software is invisible, intangible, and—in many ways—imaginary. Things happen in a millionth of a second, on top of a dozen layers of abstraction. 

By all accounts, software just shouldn't be possible. The fact that any of this works is nothing short of a miracle. So it's the least we can do to salvage any scraps of causality we can muster in our own operational domain.

"The Principle of Least Surprise" describes a general approach to software that celebrates sanity over cleverness. It is about clear intent, reasonable defaults, and providing a sense of control.

## Implicit Assumptions

## Breaking Convention


## Too Clever By Half

The mark of an expert beginner programmer is the desire to be "clever", by invoking obscure design patterns, elaborate meta-programming, or runtime manipulations teetering on the brink of calamity.

In reality, most programs just aren't that interesting. There's no reason to get fancy.

...but of course, everyone would like to think that they are the exception. The sooner you can start thinking of the project in front of you in terms of engineering rather than performance art, the better off you'll be.

Objective-C provides a number of avenues for creative hackery, from method swizzeling and associated objects, to forward invocations and compiler directives. Powerful, though they are, these advanced tricks should be seen as a last resort, reserved for cases when no reasonable alternative exists.
