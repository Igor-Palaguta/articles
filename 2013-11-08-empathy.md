Great software is created to scratch one's own itch. Being close to a problem provides not only insight in how to solve it, but the motivation to actually follow through.

It's the better angels of our nature that compel us to share these solutions with each other. And in the open source world, we do so freely, with only a karmic expectation of paying the favor foward.

We naturally want to help one another, to explain ideas, to be generous and patient. However, on the Internet, human nature seems to drop a few packets. Practicing empathy online becomes a feat of moral athleticism. Lacking many of the faculties to humanize and understand one another—facial expressions, voice tonality, non-verbal cues—we can lose sight of who we're talking to, and become less human ourselves.

Everything you need to succeed as a software developer extends from a conscious practice of empathy.

Bewilderment. Excitement. Confusion. Frustration.
